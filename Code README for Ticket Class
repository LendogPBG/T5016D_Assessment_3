# Ticket Class README
## Overview
The `Ticket` class is a Python class designed to handle the creation and management of support tickets for an organization. It automates the tracking of ticket statuses, responses, and overall ticket management operations.
## Features
- **Ticket Tracking:** Each ticket is uniquely identified and tracked through an incrementing ticket number starting from 2000.
- **Automatic Status Management:** Tickets are automatically set to "Open Ticket" upon creation and can be transitioned to "Closed Ticket" or "Reopened" based on the user actions.
- **Dynamic Response Handling:** Responses to tickets can be added, and special handling for password change requests is included.
- **Statistics:** Class methods provide statistical data about the number of tickets created, resolved, and currently open.
## Attributes
- `ticket_number`: A unique identifier for the ticket.
- `staff_id`: Identifier for the staff member handling the ticket.
- `creator_name`: Name of the person who created the ticket.
- `contact_email`: Contact email address of the ticket creator.
- `description`: Description of the issue or request.
- `response`: Admin's response to the ticket.

## Class Methods
- `ticket_stats(cls)`: Returns a string detailing the total number of tickets, the number resolved and those still open.
